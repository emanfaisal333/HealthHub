## 🧠 About The Project

**HealthHub** aims to simplify access to essential healthcare services. The system enables users to:
- Book doctor appointments
- Order medicines and schedule lab tests
- Track and manage blood pressure readings
- Receive personalized health advice

Doctors can register, log in, and oversee their appointments, while administrators manage the backend — including medicines, tests, and doctor profiles.
